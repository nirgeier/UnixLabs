- Congratulations! You have reached room 9!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- In this room we will create a new Linux shell command named `escape`.
- I order to pass this room you will need to implement the `escape` command.

- The `escape` command should do the following:
  
```sh
escape <number>
    Calculate the sum of the numbers up to the given number.

    Usage:
        $ escape 10 
        (print out 55, [1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55])
```

- Once you done execute the `getKey.sh`
  - The `getKey` will test your command with few numbers. 
  - Once the `getLey` is happy with the results it will print out the password.
  
Good Luck !!!
