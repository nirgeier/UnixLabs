- Congratulations! You have reached room 8!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- In this room we will play with Linux users & processes.

***********************************************
** Read all the instruction before you start **
***********************************************

Tasks: 
------

1. Create a bash script named 'room08_proc.sh'
2. The script should keep running forever without any output.
3. Create a new user: 'testUser'
4. Execute the script with the user 'testUser' in the background!
   >> Yes in the background! means that your shell wont get affected.
      So if you don't know how its a good time to learn it....
5. Find out the process ID (PID) of the running script.
6. Pass the PID to the script and you should get the password to the next room.

Good Luck !!!
