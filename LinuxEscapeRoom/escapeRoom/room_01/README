This is what you need to do in the First room:
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to 'room_files' folder

2. delete/move/filter-out all the files with 'txt' extension.
   - highly recommended to backup the folder before you make changes

3. Sort the remaining files by size 
   - Descending Order, including the hidden files!! 
  
4. View the file names on the screen, then take the **first letter** of each filename top-to-bottom.
 
5. Once you discover the hidden message, move to the next room.

6. Open the README file using the hidden message in **lowercase** without spaces...
