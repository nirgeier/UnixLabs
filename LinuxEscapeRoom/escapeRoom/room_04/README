- Congratulations! You have reached room 4!!
 
To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- The room keeper of this place is a crazy guy who speaks very odd.
- To be able to read the message you will need to do the following:
  1. The room keeper doesn't like the letter `H` so he replaced it with `zing` (dont ask me why...)
  2. He is not into `h` as well, so he replace it with `blu`.
  3. He despise the letter `i`, so he prefer to say it as `bla`.
- The keeper **love** to use `sed` command....

- What is the password to the next room?
  >>> Hint: keep looking around the folder....
