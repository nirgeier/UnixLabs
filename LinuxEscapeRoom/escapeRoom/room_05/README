- Congratulations! You have reached room 5!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- To proceed you need to figure out a way to get past the locked door. 
- In order to open the door you will need to do the following:
  1. Extract the key that is hidden inside the script in this folder.

Hints:
* Find out the type of the script - in which language the script is written?
* The information on how to lock the door is hidden as `Extended Attribute`
* Once you figure out what need to be done - just execute the `lockedDoor` script 

In case you are really lost - unlock the hint script in this folder (key=hints)
