- Congratulations! You have reached room 7!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- In room #7 we shell play the 7 boom game.
- The original 7 boom game is played in the range of 1-100.
- We will change the rules and calculate the 7 boom numbers between 1 to 1000 
- The rules are very simple:
  - If a number is divided by 7 (without leftover), or has the digit 7 in it (for example: 7,778 etc)
    the number is counted as `boom` number  

Tasks: 
------

1. Since we want to learn bash scripting write a `bash script` which prints out how many boom numbers are between 1 to 1000. 
  You can still do it manually if you wish :-)

2. With the password that you got unzip the `room7.zip` file
3. Once you unzipped the content find a bash function which print out the contents of the .txt file 
   with lines wrapped after `80` characters, **without** splitting any words!!!. (command)
4. The password will popup in the file.

Good Luck !!!
