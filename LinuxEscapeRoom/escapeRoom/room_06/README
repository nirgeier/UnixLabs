- Congratulations! You have reached room 6!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- This room is about filtering and text manipulation (hint: cat, awk, grep, sed, cut).
- To proceed you need to do the following on the 'table.csv':

1. Filter the `files` column content.
2. Filter only `png` extensions files
3. Remove the `junk` from the file names
4. Sort by alphanumeric order
5. Remove the `.png` extension and the numbers
6. Save the output lines in a file named 'message', each word in separate line 
7. Execute the node script to get the key

Good Luck!!
